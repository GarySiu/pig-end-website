            <h3 id="h3-sec-one">Our History</h3>
            <p id="text-sec-one">
            Both from engineering backgrounds, one of us from Poland and one from the UK, we have been working, learning and exploring the world together for eighteen years. After many adventures in Europe, Africa and Asia, we chose to settle permanently in the lovely land of Lower Silesia in Poland, in the former Lausitz, at the border triangle of Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic. Inspired by our experiences and the people we met we have brought back many ideas, handicrafts and curiostities to join with the rich cultures and traditions of the local area. With all these influences in mind we have lovingly prepared rooms for our guests in The Mill House Włosień. You can experience a taste of India, China, and Eastern Europe inside a building that has been restored with every respect for local tradition.
